- R package plyr (we used version 1.8.6)

The user can either use 'lp_solve' or the 'GNU Linear Programming Kit' (GLPK) to solve the mixed integer program. 
The two choices have different requirements:

lp_solve:
- R package lpSolveAPI (we used version 5.5.2.0)

GLPK:
- R package Rglpk (we used version 0.6-4)
